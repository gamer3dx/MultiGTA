# MultiGTA

Gamemode for [San Andreas Multiplayer][samp].

Written on [PAWN scription language][pawn].

Basically, it was my old school project just for fun, but it was very interesting, so I'v implemented many features.
Originally based on GTO gamemode.

Features: 
*   RPG system with levels.
*   Login, registration, autologin.
*   Business system.
*   Housing system.
*   Many types of events: boxing, groundhold, deathmatches, races, hays, cashbox, hotspots.
*   Admin system based on privilegies
*   Included anticheats
*   Object streamers, to avoid default limitation
*   Bank
*   Priate messages
*   Multilanguage
*   And many more things, don't remember all of them.

Uploaded here just for historical purposes, didn't tested with latest server version.
